# Malware Analysis Tool

A simple and sleek malware analysis tool with a **Tokyo Night theme** GUI, allowing users to upload files and get results from VirusTotal. Built with Python using `Tkinter` for the user interface, it computes the file's MD5 hash and checks the hash against VirusTotal for known malware detections.
